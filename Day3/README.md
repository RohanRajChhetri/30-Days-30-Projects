The ChatBot didnt work because the i needed to pay for the api key but i will try to make one using ollama which is free and a llm which i can run locally so it might work.

yayy!!! the ollama chatbot works, but note that you need to install ollama and also a model 


Requirements:
pip install openai
pip install langchain langchain-ollama ollama

get api key from this link
https://platform.openai.com/api-keys
or https://platform.deepseek.com/api_keys
