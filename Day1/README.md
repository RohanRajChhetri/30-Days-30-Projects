Day 1
todays project was to build conway's game of life.
It took a while, but i did manage to figure out how it works and the key concept. i had never used numpy but today i learned how numpy works. also i figured out how to create and manupulate grids. So overall i think it was a successful day for my 30 days 30 project challange.

PS: The Game_of_life(Visualisation).py file is a file which i created using AI just to visualize my project, i dont know how pygame work so i used AI, however Game_of_life.py is created 100% coded by me.
